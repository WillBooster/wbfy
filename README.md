:books::rocket: A tool for applying WillBooster's conventional configurations to npm packages

[![Test](https://github.com/WillBooster/wbfy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WillBooster/wbfy/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Motivation

There are some resources for creating a project with conventional configurations like [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), GitHub's Template repository, and starter-kit repositories.
However, we sometimes faced the cases where we wanted to apply conventional configurations to an existing repository, so we've launch this tool!

## Philosophy

This tool must keep idempotency, i.e., it always yields the same result when a user applies this tool to a project even multiple times.

## How to Use

1. `yarn dlx wbfy <project directory>`
